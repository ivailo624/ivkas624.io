                            According to a recent U.K. survey, bloggers have ranked as the third most trustworthy source of information, following only friends and family. That's right -- bloggers are trusted more than celebrities, journalists, brands, and politicians.

                            But how do you get people to fall in love with your blog in the first place? (Aside from remarkable content, of course.)
                            Well, just as your website homepage is like the front door to your business, your blog's design -- much like a welcome mat -- is the front door to your business blog.
